"""Bulk actions must survive a batch where only some ids are still valid.

Partial success is the normal case: a member can be deleted in another tab
while the operator is ticking boxes. Failing the whole batch for that would
make them redo work that already succeeded, so each id is attempted on its own
and the failures are named.

Deletion is deliberately absent from the allowed actions: a mis-click on a
checkbox column is easy, and bulk delete is the one action with no way back.
