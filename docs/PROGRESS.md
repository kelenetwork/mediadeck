## 2026-08-28 — Phase 1 scaffold
**Done**
- Repo initialized (public), FastAPI backend skeleton.
- Config strictly from env (`.env.example` only in repo); mock/live adapter
  architecture so the whole panel runs credential-free with `MEDIADECK_MOCK=1`.
- Load-aware 302 stream scheduler: normalized load = active_streams/weight,
  health probing with failure threshold, manual disable/enable, dispatch
  dry-run endpoint, real `/stream/{path}` 302 edge.
- Emby adapter (users, active sessions) in mock + live variants.
- 5 smoke tests passing; dev workflow codified in DEVELOPMENT.md.

**Next**
- Pipeline overview module: read-only queue/quota state via a host-local
  collector script that exports sanitized JSON (keeps real paths out of repo).
- Node probe agent (single-file, deployable to streaming nodes).

**Open questions**
- Panel domain: undecided (owner: "whatever for now").
- Frontend stack decision deferred until Phase 4 UI pass.
